# Supermarket_Express
Programming script for the International Students Capstone Design Competition (i-CAPS) 2019 Team Supermarket Express

The aim of this project is to create a prototype smart Supermarket for a hands-free shopping experience. Various sensors such as RFID, barcode scanner is used to achieve this experience.

The program used Robot Operating System as the main coordinating system, with sub-programs written for each component (sensors, 
acutators, GUI etc)

The script is mainly in Python, and Tkinter library is used to generate the GUI program. Many libraries are referenced in this 
program. Many credits are due to the original author of those libraries.
